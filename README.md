# TSP
Program, written in C++, which solves the Travelling Salesman Problem (aka TSP).

TSP is regarded as 'The Holy Grail of Computer Science'. The problem consists of a certain 
number of cities and the task is the find the shortest Hamiltonian Cycle, connecting all the cities.

The algorithm used is Simulated Annealiing (aka SA). SA is a randomized algorithm and hence may not give the same output
for the same input. The program is not guaranteed to produce the optimal solution.

The program works for an input of <500 cities.
