# TSP
Program,  written in C++, which solves the Travelling Salesman Problem.

Travelling Salesman Problem (aka TSP) is regarded the Holy Grail of computer science. The problem consists of a certain 
number of cities and the task is the find the shortest Hamiltonian Cycle, connecting all the cities.

The algorithm used is Simulated Annealiing (aka SA). SA is a randomized algorithm and hence may not give the same output
for the same input. The program is not guaranteed to produce the optimal solution, but always gives a sub-optimal solution.

The program works for an input of 100-500 cities.
